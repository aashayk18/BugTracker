2. This will give you a folder structure like e.g. com.simsoft.bugtracker.
3. Have internal folders module wise.
4. Within every module, have functionality wise folders. E.g.
	a. Beans
	b. Action-classes
	c. Constants
	d. UX
	e. Tags
	f. Servlets
	g. And so on.
5. Servlet should be preferably one per business object. Like â€“ BugServlet, DashBoardServlet, WorkflowServlet etc.
6. There should be no action class functionality in servlet. Servlet should only co-ordinate info flow.
7. Have a util module for all your utility classes.
8. Every loop should have a try catch block within the loop.
